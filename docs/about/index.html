	<div class="p-summary introduction">
		<p>Hej!Â ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tim Klapdor</p>
<p>I work in Higher Education. I live in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=adelaide&amp;ia=web&amp;iaxm=about">Adelaide, Australia</a>.</p>

	</div>
    
	<p><img src="/images/IMG_3394.jpg" alt="Photo of Tim Klapdor, lit using a neon colour palette" class="img-left"></p>
<p>I'm a creative at heart. I apply my talent for problem solving to things that have to do with technology and learning. I still occasionally weild a ðŸŽ¸ guitar or ðŸ“· camera, and still have a muscle memory for Adobe shortcuts to help design the occassional logo or poster. I dabble in code, building simple websites â€” like this one.</p>
<hr>
<p>I would describe myself as an <strong>Expert Generalist</strong> with skills spanning graphic design, multimedia, web design, project leadership, visual communication, user experience, learning design, course development, online teaching, online systems, interface design and information architecture.</p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, I am a Manager of Educational Design at the University of Adelaide. In this role I have led the capability and capacity development of the University's online programs.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overseeing course development for all under-graduate and post-graduate programs.</li>
<li>Recruitment, training and development of staff and establishment of shared processes and practices.</li>
<li>The development of the Online Quality Framework.</li>
<li>Four fully online research capstone courses spanning the Masters of Business Administration, Data Science, Cyber Security and Psycology programs.</li>
<li>The development and rollout of the MathTrackX series of MOOCs available through EdX.</li>
<li>Creation of a Learning Design system that is being adopted across the institution.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I have a keen interest in innovation and developing and implementing new technologies within an educational context to enhance the learning experience. I believe that technology offers a range of unique opportunities to actualise a range of pedagogical and instructional approaches which can revolutionise the education sector. I love the challenge that new technology brings and the creative process involved in developing an idea through to implementation.</p>
<p>Working at the nexus of technology and education, I have developed a skill for translating ideas, concepts and goals into technological solutions that improve the user experience. I am a skilled communicator who works especially hard to translate â€˜tech speakâ€™ into something tangible and understandable.</p>
<p>Always open to new opportunities, I have been working to establish a broad and international personal learning network by working in the open, engaging in social media, writing academically, presenting at conferences and blogging extensively. At the same time, I have become increasingly fluent in leadership responsibilities, large-scale projects and team management. I am poised for further change and growth and ready to seize the next big opportunity.</p>
