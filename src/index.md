Learning types describe the intention of learning, the ways which we wish students would engage in order to learn. They define the experience we are trying to design and act to guide our process. 
</div>

They help us to critically engage with the course, its concepts and topics in order to design an experience that best fits the the specific moment in the course. 

Learning types are not learning styles as they are not defined by the student or the medium, but by the concept itself. They don’t define learning as a singular activity or action, but as a way to form a sequence of learning or a Lesson. This sequence would utilise a combination of learning types in order to engage students in different cognitive tasks in order to create multiple opportunities to engage with a concept. 

For example Learning to ride a bike. 

1. A lesson might start with an introduction and stepped process explaining how to ride a bike. There might be a demonstration and a video of someone riding a bike. At this point students are Assimilating that information and learning the background of the task. 
2. Students then move on to Practice that task. They actually attempt it and try for them selves. 
3. At this point they may not understand how to carry out the task and need feedback on their attempt. They might produce a video of themselves attempting to ride and from that get feedback and instructions from their teacher. 
4. They may practice again and see they have made progress and are now capable of unsteady. The next instructions might point students back to the demonstration video and ask  them to review their own efforts against the this video as a way to improve. 

Any pedagogical models try to highlight a specific learning the way to facilitate learning. For example, discovery based learning focuses on a specific type of leading the chemist, facilitated and seen in the investigative learning time. Other common models might do the opposite where they are too loose with their definitions. I don’t adequately describe the nuances of the learning taking place. For example, active learning doesn’t necessarily say anything about the under activities that students would actually undertake in order to be active. If we look at the Lyn types of ways to find active learning could fit into six types of learning  , if we look at the Lyn types of ways to find active learning could fit into six types of learning, probably just excluding me a similar type of defiance which is more around consumption and simulation of content rather than specific activities. So to social learning doesn’t really define activities that students will undertake all the weigh that they will attempt to learn a concept reply concert, nearly but it’s just done within a social context  Cool account for both discursive and social living times
