This is a work in progress and personal project to bring together my work over the years into one place. I'm also planning to use this site to adopt a [[POSSE]] (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere) workflow.

Over the next few months I'll be publishing new blog posts and micro-blogs here, and beginning to build out an Evergreen Notes section as a shortcut to some of the reference points in my work and thinking. 

### The Name

The name was inspired by the lyrics of a death 'n' roll band when I was looking for something to sum up a blog I was setting up on [Wordpress.com](https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/) in 2011 to record an upcoming trip to the United States. I wanted a way to record the trip, make notes, collect ideas and express opinions. Heart Soul Machine summed up that I wanted to use the blog to openly record what makes me tick and my commentary on technology (the Machine). 

I lucked out on the trip going to the [Breaking Development conference](https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2011/04/13/breaking-development-wrap-up/) and, through Twitter, managed to gain an audience. I found the writing process empowering and therapeutic throughout the last decade, and my writing has helped me connect with people worldwide. While on WordPress, the blog has focussed on the Heart and Soul elements, but by bringing this site together, my aim is to share more of the Machine - my work and the various projects and experiments I've developed over the years.
