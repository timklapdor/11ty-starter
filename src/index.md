This is a work in progress and personal project to bring together my work over the years into one place. I'm also planning to use this site to adopt a POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere) workflow.

Over the next few months I'll be publishing new blog posts and micro-blogs here, and beginning to build out an Evergreen Notes section as a shortcut to some of the reference points in my work and thinking. 

### The Name

Heart Soul Machine dates back to 2011 when I set up a blog on [Wordpress.com](https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/) to record an upcoming trip to the United States. I wanted a way to record the trip, make notes, collect ideas and express opinions. I lucked out on the trip going to the B[reaking Development conference](https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2011/04/13/breaking-development-wrap-up/) and through Twitter managed to get gain an audience. I found the writing process empowering and theraputic through out the last decade and my writing has helped me connect with people around the world. While on Wordpress, the blog has focussed on the Heart and Soul elements, but by bringing this site togeter my aim is to share more of the Machine - my work and the various projects and experiments I've developed over the years.
