summary: The role of a manager seems like an odd one. Why are they here? And by extension, why am I here? What exactly does a manager do? What can they actually do?
---

During one of my many meetings, I pondered,  "What exactly do I do?". How limited are my actions in this process? I decided to write down what actions I am able to actually implement and came up with this short list.

- **Debate** - bring people together to resolve conflicts.
- **Delete** - remove the task, it's not going to happen.
- **Delegate** - apply someone else to the task.
- **Delay** - push back the task to a later date.
- **Defer** - put the task on hold until it is required.
- **Double down** - add extra resourcing to ensure that it gets done.
- **Diminish** - reduce the scope of the task to something that will actually be completed. 

Now, this list diminishes the role of **experience** and **context awareness**, as these play a vital role in taking the *right* actions, but nonetheless, the possible actions of the manager are very limited. I think this is why being a manager so often feels unfulfilling and can be frustrating. There isn't a lot of creativity possible within these constraints. Because of that limitation, it's not very attractive to those with the right experience or context awareness - and this is what breeds managerialism - where those with limited experience and context take on manager roles and proceed to make poor decisions.
