summary: Rather than making resolutions — although there are a few key areas of life I need to resolve and work on — I thought I'd plan some dos and don'ts instead.
---
This is to lay out the behaviours I want to see from myself and acknowledge the less desirable ones, as well as a way of checking myself against falling down a rabbit hole. 

| Dos | Don’ts |
|--- | --- |
| Develop a sustainable routine and rhythm to the week. |Lurch from one thing to the next like a drunk maniac.|
| Sweat every day. I need to work on my fitness and consistently. | Use the weather as an excuse. Match the activity to the weather, one is out of your control. |
| Focus on career development. Work towards the future. | Focus less on my current job. It’s fine, and you’re already good at it. |
| Move away from the drama. Start to call it out, but don’t buy into it. | Get sucked into the drama vortex. Face what’s in front of me not the periphery. |
| Stop talking, start doing. Start making things happen. *Make the future*. | Stop over thinking and wishful thinking.  |
| More food prep. Take the stress out of cooking and make life easier. | The carbs. This is the default solution for a lack of preparation, but it’s not helping at all. |
| Be more social. Make more effort to go out, to call people and reconnect with friendships. | Isolate yourself. I recognise the trauma of COVID and the reaction to seal myself off, but it's not healthy. |
| Connect. Find the others. Get out of my shell and meet more people, build a network, find a way. | Fall back to what was. That's still there, but there's a need to push forward now. |
