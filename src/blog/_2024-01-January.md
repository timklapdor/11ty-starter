summary: My first public journal post for 2024. I'm going to try this out as a monthly thing - so far not many attempts or formats have stuck! We live and learn and I'll keep trying to find something that sticks.

### The Vibe

The vibe has been chilled. I've had pretty much all of January off from work, which has provided some much-needed rest and space to think. It's been a staycation - half planned, half because of circumstances (wife with COVID and some financial constraints). At the end of 2023, I was probably heading towards another burnout. I think I had two episodes in that year alone, but this time, I recognised the signs and, with my leave approaching, was able to switch off and not go down that path. Christmas away with family was a quick defuse of the situation, but I felt that I wasn't really present for my family during that time. 

January kicked off back at home — with a plan to eat better, exercise and get my shit together. Part of getting my shit together was enrolling in the [Focus Course](https://thefocuscourse.com/Course/). I came across the course via a blog post earlier in the year that discussed the busted flywheel that leads to burnout -

This really resonated with where I've been at work for the last year, but maybe longer. It does describe where I get to in terms of work and life at my lowest points. I don't suffer from depression - but this flywheel perfectly describes me at my worst. It's great being able to recognise something, but I needed to make changes. With two weeks of the focus course complete I have gone back to look at my core values, articulated a vision for my life that I feel good about, and started to work on some goals. This all ties in to making some changes to diet and exercise and I feel much more mentally prepared for the new year. The sense of impending burnout has gone and now I feel more focussed.  

There are still two weeks of the course left, so there is plenty more to do, but my next big step is to feel more practised. To embed the changes into my everyday life. The challenge comes from going back to work and school and the drumbeat of the everyday returns. 

Going back to the gym has been good. I do enjoy doing something more physically engaging and feeling better connected to my body - which often feels more like a flesh suit my brain is wearing. 

One of the things I have been thinking through and working on has been to create a side hustle, something that I can challenge myself with but also open up some new possibilities. I've spent the last 7 years working on designing better learning experiences and I've created a bunch of resources and processes to do that. My plan is to build on that over the year and create some opportunities to share that. I'm hoping to have a starting point up online in the next month... so keep an eye out. 

### Photos
A couple of my favourite snaps from the month.

### Recommendations
Based on what I've been watching, reading and listening to I'd recommend the following:

- [30 Media/08 Watched/Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland|Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt27837209/) - A harrowing documentary told through historical footage and interviews. It reminded me of lunchtimes I had while working up in the north of Ireland and living in Derry. 
- A [fascinating video](https://youtu.be/z7DuvWVazpk) on Australian vowel sounds. A lot of the technical stuff is over my head, but I love that you can accurately describe these very nuanced aspects of language and sound. 
- Binged on [The Bear](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) S01 and S02. It's an interesting mix of themes and vibes, it has a 'feel good' tone while dealing with really traumatic themes. 
- [Beef](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14403178/) – Interesting story, great characters and premise. I loved the final episode. 
- [Mr Bates vs. The Post Office](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt27867155/) was an interesting portrayal of events in the British Postal System where Post Masters were blamed and held liable for software accounting errors. I can see a lot of similarities with Robodebt - and also what the next round of AI applications will be like. We have been warned. 
- [O.J. Made in America](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt13320728/) I made it to E04, the courtroom episode, which was the first time I'd seen the crime scene photos and been exposed to the DNA evidence. That was a horrific murder, and he got away with something terrible. The courtroom events were made for the tabloid media, and shockingly, it was allowed to take place. The final episode is wild. OJ fell off the radar here in Australia and his ending was not something I recall hearing anything about. 
- [Black Bird](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4301160/) - amazing series on Apple TV+. Truly great acting and storylines that run the gauntlet between deeply humanising and horrific and terrifying. The power of contrast is used perfectly throughout the series, balancing out the horrific and the beautiful. The pick of the series is The Pla
- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) - binged this podcast series on cyber attacks and defence. There are lots of really good stories explaining professional skills in more depth, and this matters.
