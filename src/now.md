I'm living in [Adelaide, South Australia](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=adelaide&ia=web&iaxm=about). I'm married and our family consists of a 13yo daughter and a 3yo kelpie. 

I work at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) as a Manager of Educational Design. I oversaw the development of [two fully online undergraduate programs](https://www.open.edu.au/universities/the-university-of-adelaide) and am now working on courses for the new [merged university](https://adelaideuni.edu.au/).

I'm currently working on setting up this site as a Domain of Ones Own - a place on the internet I can call mine. This is version 1.0 of the site.

I'm dedicated to exploring the professionalisation of Learning Design and am developing a Learning Design system and creating a software tool to aid the development of learning experiences.

I'm currently reading [I Shall Wear Midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Shall_Wear_Midnight) by [Terry Pratched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett).
