summary: For 2024 I signed up for Shawn Blanc's Focus Course to help me work through my current state and bring back some focus into my life.

The [Focus Course](https://thefocuscourse.com/Course/) is a short course that sells itself on the concept of focus:

>Other courses and training on time management and productivity often center on how to get more done in less time. But that only helps with efficiency.
>
> People who measure success by the quantity of things they get done will never win. There are ALWAYS more new things to do.
> 
> **You don't need more time...
> You need more focus.**

The selling point for me was how well some of the diagnosed problems were articulated and how they resonated with some of my existing behaviours. This year, I realised that 'burnout' was something that I hadn't experienced (multiple times) but that was on track for another episode. The timing of the course matched some leave I had booked in and so I took the opportunity to attend. 

Over four weeks the course works through the following areas:

1. [Vision](../../blog/2024/01-28-vision-week/)
2. Strategy
3. Habits
4. Margin
