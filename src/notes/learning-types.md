There are a number of distinct ways in which learn. These are is seperate to learning styles or preferences, and instead focus on being foundational descriptions of the ways in which we learn. 

-   **Assimilative** - Learning through presented information
-   **Investigative** - Learning by seeking information 
-   **Formative** - Learning by trying 
-   **Discursive** - Learning by engaging with other perspectives
-   **Productive** - Learning by creating artefacts
-   **Evaluative** - Learning through feedback
-   **Social** - Learning with others

These definitions are based on Laurillard (2002), who developed a set of 'Learning Types' as part of her Conversational Framework: Acquisition, Investigation, Practice, Production, Collaboration and Discussion. This work helped establish a way of thinking about learning, and a need for a typology that was made of adjectives of learning. The other aim of this work was to shift away from the tradition teacher led conversational model so that it could suit an instructor-embedded model of learning suitable for online delivery.
