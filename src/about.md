I'm a creative at heart. I apply my talent for problem solving to things that have to do with technology and learning. I still occasionally weild a ðŸŽ¸ guitar or ðŸ“· camera, and still have a muscle memory for Adobe shortcuts to help design the occassional logo or poster. I dabble in code, building simple websites â€” like this one.

I would describe myself as an **Expert Generalist** with skills spanning graphic design, multimedia, web design, project leadership, visual communication, user experience, learning design, course development, online teaching, online systems, interface design and information architecture.

Currently, I am a Manager of Educational Design at the University of Adelaide. In this role I have led the capability and capacity development of the University's online programs. 

This includes:

- Overseeing course development for all under-graduate and post-graduate programs.
- Recruitment, training and development of staff and establishment of shared processes and practices. 
- The development of the Online Quality Framework. 
- Four fully online research capstone courses spanning the Masters of Business Administration, Data Science, Cyber Security and Psycology programs. 
- The development and rollout of the MathTrackX series of MOOCs available through EdX.
- Creation of a Learning Design system that is being adopted across the institution.

I have a keen interest in innovation and developing and implementing new technologies within an educational context to enhance the learning experience. I believe that technology offers a range of unique opportunities to actualise a range of pedagogical and instructional approaches which can revolutionise the education sector. I love the challenge that new technology brings and the creative process involved in developing an idea through to implementation.  
  
Working at the nexus of technology and education, I have developed a skill for translating ideas, concepts and goals into technological solutions that improve the user experience. I am a skilled communicator who works especially hard to translate â€˜tech speakâ€™ into something tangible and understandable.  
  
Always open to new opportunities, I have been working to establish a broad and international personal learning network by working in the open, engaging in social media, writing academically, presenting at conferences and blogging extensively. At the same time, I have become increasingly fluent in leadership responsibilities, large-scale projects and team management. I am poised for further change and growth and ready to seize the next big opportunity.
