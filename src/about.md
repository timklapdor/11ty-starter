    Hej!Â ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tim Klapdor

    I'm a 43-year-old cisgender male (he/him) based in [Adelaide, South Australia](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=adelaide&ia=web&iaxm=about). I'm married, and our family consists of an 13-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old Kelpie. I work in Higher Education and am passionate about learning, technology and jumping into a problem space.

I'm a creative at heart. I apply my talent for problem-solving to things that have to do with technology and learning. I still occasionally wield a ðŸŽ¸ guitar or ðŸ“· camera, and I still have muscle memory for Adobe shortcuts to help design a friend's logo or poster. I dabble in code, building simple websites â€” like this one.

You can find me on [a bunch of other sites](https://timklapdor.me) too.

- Recruitment, training and development of staff and establishment of shared processes and practices. 
- The development of the Online Quality Framework. 
- Four fully online research capstone courses spanning the Masters of Business Administration, Data Science, Cyber Security and Psychology programs. 
- The development and rollout of the MathTrackX series of MOOCs available through EdX.
- Creation of a Learning Design system that is being adopted across the institution.

I am keenly interested in innovation and developing and implementing new technologies within an educational context to enhance the learning experience. I believe that technology offers a range of unique opportunities to actualise a range of pedagogical and instructional approaches that can revolutionise the education sector. I love the challenge that new technology brings and the creative process involved in developing an idea through to implementation.
  
Working at the nexus of technology and education, I have developed a skill for translating ideas, concepts and goals into technological solutions that improve the user experience. I am a skilled communicator who works especially hard to translate â€˜tech speakâ€™ into something tangible and understandable.  
  
Always open to new opportunities, I have been working to establish a broad and international personal learning network by working in the open, engaging in social media, writing academically, presenting at conferences and blogging extensively. At the same time, I have become increasingly fluent in leadership responsibilities, large-scale projects and team management. I am poised for further change and growth and ready to seize the next big opportunity.
